Task Description:

In this project, you'll dive into the idea of using multiple models together, known as model ensembles, to make our deep learning solutions more accurate. They are a reliable approach to improve accuracy of a deep learning solution for the added cost of running multiple networks. Using ensembles is a trick that's widely used by the winners of AI competitions. Task of the students: explore approaches to model ensemble construction for semantic segmentation, select a dataset (preferentially cardiac MRI segmentation, but others also allowed), find an open-source segmentation solution as a baseline for the selected dataset and test it. Train multiple models and construct an ensemble from them. Analyse the improvements, benefits and added costs of using an ensemble.
